# Configuring Salt cloud 

## Pre-requisites

- 1 host with salt-master software installed in azure 

## installing Salt-Cloud software 
   
   for managing puproses it is better to install salt-master on the salt-master 
   you can install Salt-Cloud on ubuntu with the following commands: 
   
       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:saltstack/salt
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install salt-cloud
       
 ## adding cloud provider to salt-Cloud  
 
 Salt-Cloud is Capable of connecting to multiple cloud providers. in this tutorial we are going to try to connect to azure. 
 
 after installing salt cloud uncomment the following lines from /etc/salt/master:
        file_roots:
          base:
            -/srv/salt
            
      
  next step create the folder /srv/salt:
    mkdir /srv/salt
    
    
    in order to use salt-cloud and connect to azure we need to create an azure provider configuration. open /etc/salt/cloud.providers.d/azure.conf and add the following lines:
       
          my-azure-provider:
  driver: azure
  subscription_id: 332b184f-faaf-455d-a1d8-0110e1131ab
  certificate_path: /etc/salt/azure.pem

  minion:
    master: mysaltmaster.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
    
    you need to adjust this configuration file to your case (subscription id,master DNS)
    
    you need to create the .pem file. Execute the following command on your master VM: 
    
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout /etc/salt/azure.pem -out /etc/salt/azure.pem
    
    
    create the .cer file using the following command:
    
    openssl x509 -inform pem -in /etc/salt/azure.pem -outform der -out /etc/salt/azure.cer
